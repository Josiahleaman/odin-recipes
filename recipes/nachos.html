    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bag of tortilla chips</li>
        <li>Cheese (whichever you prefer)</li>
        <li>Salsa</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>First get yourself a plate and dump out as many chips as you like from the bag that you got earlier. Once done with that sprinkle the cheese onto the chips. This really depends on your preference whether you like a lot or a little cheese. Then slice up the onion into little pieces and sprinkle them on to the chips. Put the plate in the microwave for 30-45 seconds and then takeout. If the cheese is not melted then put them back in for another 15 seconds. While you are waiting you can take out your salsa and pour that into a bowl to dip tha nachos in. After the nachos are out of the microwave enjoy! </p>
